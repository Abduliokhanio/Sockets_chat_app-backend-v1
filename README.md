# Sockets_chat_app-backend-v1
A python chat application backend
Python version 3.7 (64 bit)

<Note to self><When Im ready to add to this project>
This is just the backend of the the chat application.
The front end needs to be developed to process the client outputs better. 
The consol is unable to process the client output live.
you have to press <enter> to see the clients update the chat.
But it works.
